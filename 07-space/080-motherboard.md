You tried to [kill the heart](060-lab/020-cocktail.md), right?

# Yes
And only the veins exploded and you are now down there with the motherboard.

# Yes, what to do?
It still has a free ISA slot?

# ISA slot?
ISA slots were used to attach computer components into motherboards.

# Go on...
Old computer components, like museum stuff.

# Museum?
There are old computer components in the museum.

# Got it
Take the ancient GPU and attach it to the motherboard.

# There!
Now you should switch it to use it.

# Where?
In the throne system. Go up there and change it to use the secondary GPU. Exit the system.
