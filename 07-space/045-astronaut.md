You have looked at the red suited astronaut in the museum.

# Yes, his name is too small
First, you have to get to [the space station](030-pressurized-door.md).

# I am out and at the bridge
Then, [open the locker](050-bridge/020-locker.md) at the tech depot.

# Got it
Now you can read the astronaut's name. Interesting...
