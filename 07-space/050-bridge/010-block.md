title: Invisible block
---

There's something blocking your access through the floor.

# What gives?
Talk to the floating robot.

# Scary
Talk to the guys about it, with the radio.

# AVR?
Do as they say. Use you AVR Drawing tool in the tech depot area. Especially in the right part of the room.

# A heart?
Remember, you are now in the permanent reality with the chip.
Tell the base about the heart.

# Okay
You should kill the heart. Try to [get access to the lab](030-throne.md).
