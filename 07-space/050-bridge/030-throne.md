Have you visited the observatory with the great view?

# Where?
Up from the Tech Depot. And up again.

# What a view!
Did you "paint" there. Use your AVR Drawing tool in the area (you have to talk with the base first).

# A throne!
If you try to use it, it asks for a team member name.

# How to know it?
There was some information about the ISS team in the museum. Look at the astrounaut with the red suit.

# It is too small
You need to find [a looking glass](020-locker.md). Use the soldering helping hand on the astronaut picture.

# Read it
Get back to the throne to access it. You can open the lab door from here.
