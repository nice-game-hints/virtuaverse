title: The carnivorous plant
---

Zaymon hinted about the carnivorous plant.

# Where is it?
If you "paint" the round area in the greenhouse you can see it.

# What to do it?
This doesn't work before you have [removed the chip from your brain](010-chip.md).

# Okay. It is removed.
The carnivorous plant should have a space fruit in its mouth.

# It bites!
Use the pincers on the fruit.
