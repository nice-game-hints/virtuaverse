title: Removing the chip
---

The chip in your brain might explode when you inject the heart.

# How to get rid of it
Talk to Zaymon. Using the tube should be safe option.

# I need anesthetics
Oh, you find them from the lab.

# Where?
Everything is hidden here, isn't it?

# What?
"Paint" the left part of the room to find the vials. Pick one up.

# Got it
Insert the anesthetic into the medicine slot in front of the tube. Get into the tube. Welcome back to the reality.
