The Boatman is there waiting for customer before the Pier.

# He can't hear me
Maybe you could attract his attention somehow.

# Like?
Like a burning hut?

# How?
You need the [gang starter kit](090-starter-kit.md) first.

# I have it
Use the solvent on the hut ^[Open the window shutter first!] to burn it!

# It burnt!
And you can help the Boatman. He now oves you a favor.
