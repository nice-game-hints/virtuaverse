[The Electrical Box](040-electric-box.md) has a touchscreen mount. Look at the touchscreen mount first. You should get a touchscreen for it.

# Where?
The place for hardware is, of course ...

# What?
The shop at the Pill Street (use your bike). Talk to the Shopkeeper and he will sell you a touchscreen.
