# Cryptic stuff

# About what?
"Are you a writer?", "Why are the QR codes on the wall", "I need information about a group of writers"

# What groups?
 - "The Blade"
 - "Onslaught"
 - "Uranium Crackers"
 - "Kid Crow"

# I don't have those
You have to scan the QR codes from the wall ^[Remove your headset] for all the four groups.

# With what?
Use the old mobile phone ^[You can buy it from the shop at Pill Street].

Go talk to the writers in the Squat.

# They don't believe me!
