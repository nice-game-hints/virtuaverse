title: Controlling the Tattoo machine
---

The Tattooist won't let you change the drawing from the touchscreen.

# Bummer
Maybe you could control it out of his sight. The wires lead you to the [Electrical Box](040-electric-box.md) outside.

# I have access to it
Now, you just need an extra [touchscreen](050-touchscreen.md).

# I have that also
Mount it into its place and wire it.

# Wiring
The correct wiring is:
 - GND- - Black wire
 - Video - Yellow wire
 - Input - White wire
 - 5V+ - Red wire

# It works!
Now you can control the tattoo machine.
