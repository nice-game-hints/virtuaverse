title: Getting a badge
---

To be part of a gang you need a badge.

# Where from?
The guy laying on the tattoo table is going to join the Blade soon. He just needs to finish his tattoo.

# Tattoo
Maybe you could mess with the tattoo?

# How?
First, you need access to [the tattoo machine](030-control-tattoo.md).

# I have it. What tattoo should I choose?
Have you tried them? They don't let him in if the tattoo is something else from Blade's.

# Yes?
But what would they do to him if he would have the tattoo of Blade's worst enemy?

# Let's find out!
Change the tattoo to Onslaught's tattoo! Have you noticed that the walls are tapered with gang QR codes? Read them through with some suitable device ^[You can buy the old mobile phone from the shop in Pill Street.].

# Can't find it
Use the following tattoo design
