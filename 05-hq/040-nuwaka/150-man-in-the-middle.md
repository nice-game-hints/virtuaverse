title: Man-in-the-middle
---

You have to hack the wood artist's headset. Jay gave you the man-in-the-middle kit (follow [this](120-shield.md) to get there).

# How did it work?
Put the kit between you and the hacked target.

# Like?
Put the kit in the Plant that is next to the stand.

# It is there
Then just click the remote control in the inventory.
