title: Laserman 3000V collectible
---

The kannonn kid would really like a Laserman 3000V collectible doll.

# They are not dolls!
Fine. But get him that.

# Where?
Have you visited the Tour Bus (not to travel but inside the bus)?

# Yes
The drummer reads the Laserman 3000V comic and there is the Happy Food box on the table ^[ Take the box to get a Laserman toy ].

# I got the toy!
Maybe the kid would like it?

# He says it is lame
Well, the _real_ one has:
 - [the shield](120-shield.md)
 - [and the suit is not that color](130-color.md)

To know what they look like, look at [the comic](../035-magazine.md)

# It is ready
So the figurine is now black and the shield is attached to it? Great. Give it to the kid.
