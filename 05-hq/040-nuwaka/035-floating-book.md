There is the floating book in the hut (you have to [register](030-register.md) first).

# What is that?
It is ASCII code. You should find the ASCII code table ^[Talk to the sys admin at Nuwaka about her arts. She will print you a paper that has the ASCII codes].

# Help me
So, every number is a letter (65 = A, 66 = B, ...)

# So..
The floating book says: "112 108 097 099 101 032 121 111 117 114 032 111 102 102 101 114 032 111 110 032 116 103 101 032 097 108 116 097 114".

# Meaning...
"place your offer on the altar"
