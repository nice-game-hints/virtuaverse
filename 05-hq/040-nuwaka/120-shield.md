The Laserman 3000V action figure is missing its shield.

# Where to?
Maybe the wood artis would carve it a new shield. Talk to her. She can build you anything if you have a plan for it.

# A plan?
Look at [the comic](110-magazine.md) for reference. So, first look at the comic in your inventory and _then_ talk to the wood artis.

# She needs...
...a 3d model? Such handcraft!

# Where to?
Didn't the sys admin at the Internet Point craft 3d models? Go ask her about it. She wil make you the model. Talk to her about it.

# She did it
Now go talk back to the wood artist.

# She is busy!
Her headset is full of ideas. You have cut in with you model. You need to _hack_.

# How?
Would your friends at the Blade know more?

# Really?
Really. Travel back to Blade HQ and talk to Jay. She will give you a man-in-the-middle kit.

# I have it
Good. Then just hack [her headset](150-man-in-the-middle.md).

# Hacked!
Go pick the shield. You can now attach it to the figurine.
