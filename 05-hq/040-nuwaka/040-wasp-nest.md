title: Passing the wasp nest
---

There is the waterfall in the jungle but those damn wasps are blocking your way.

# What to do to them?
Wasps don't deal nice with fire.

# Fire?
There is a flame burning near the waterfall.

# Yes?
Maybe you could build a torch to get the fire and run the wasps away.

# How?
Well, first you need a branch. There is a branch near the ground next to the marsh at the first jungle part. Saw ^[You can find a saw in the swamp in front of the Hut after the waterfall] it off.

# I have the branch
Cool. A torch also needs some burning material. Use the panties on the branch.

# A torch!
Close! It does not ignite yet.

# Ignite?
Use the torch in the gas pump next to the Carage.

# A proper torch!
Use the torch on the flame and then drive the wasps away.
