title: Getting rid of the mechanic
---

The mechanic isn't really a nice person. And he doesn't let you pick stuff in his carage.

# What gives?
Have you talked with him about fixing the Tour bus? He should give you his business card.

# I have his business card
Now, could you drive him mad with the AVR spam?

# How?
His business card has the address. Now you should just buy "services" for him.

# Services?
Go talk to the Online Service Broker at the station in the Blade HQ. Show him the business card.

# Nice
He is on phone now. Go to the carage.

# And next?
Is he distracted?

# No?
Use the keybox, pick up the office key and shut him into the room with the key.
