You can travel to Jakharrak only after you have talked with the [Cypher Master](040-nuwaka/010-cypher-master.md). You have to find the source code.

# Where to start?
Find [the archeologist](010-archeologist.md).

# I found him
Get the [AVR chip](100-avr.md) and show it to Jay at the Blade HQ. Use the computer and listen all of the sound files.

# Okay
So, your mission is to finish the archeologists job and install the antennas using his scanner for help. You got a journal entry from this.

# How to install them?
[Enable the scanner.](015-scanner.md)

# Its working now
Now just find the [two positions](060-antennas/index.md) for the antennas.

# The antennas are in place
Great. Now go back to the hut and check out the monitor. All three circles should be green.
