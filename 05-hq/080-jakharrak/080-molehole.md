That thing stole _your_ components!

# I can't fit to that hole
Maybe some other bot could do.

# What?
Like, [the cleaning bot](030-cleaning-bot.md) from the lighthouse.

# I have it, but...
You would need a remote control for it.

# What?
Do you have some item with you that could give some _power_ to the bot?

# Power?
The Ultra Glove of Power, of course. Use it on the cleaning bot.

# Remote control!
You can now use the cleaning bot on the mole hole again.

# Water...
The water is preventing you from getting through.
