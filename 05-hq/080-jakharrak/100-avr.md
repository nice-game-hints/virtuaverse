# Where?
Search around the Hut.

# What?
There is a bone right of the hut. Dig it up. ^[ You can find a shovel at the Hardware Graveyard. Little bit right from the android ].

# It is up
Did you notice the skull?

# Yes
Look at it. There is something glaring inside.

# And?
Hit the skull with your shovel. Pick up the AVR chip. Read your journal entry.
