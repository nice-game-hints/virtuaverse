The scanner is not making any sound. It is not enabled when Nathan says "It is not emitting any sound."

# How to fix it?
The key lays at the hut.

# The hut?
There is the main antenna. It will help to use the scanner.

# What to do?
Use the antenna pole (beneath the actual antenna) twice and the scanner starts to work.
