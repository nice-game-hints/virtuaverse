title: Getting an antenna
---

There is an antenna on top of [the lighthouse](020-lighthouse.md).

# It is bolted
Maybe you could build your own.

# How?
First, look at the antenna.

# Looked
Then create your own using electronic components.

# Electronic components?
You need two of them.

# Where?
One is outside the Hut at Jakharrak. The other one you get after talking to the droid (and lifting it outside) in the Hut. Combine them in your inventory.
