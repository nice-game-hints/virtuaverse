title: Building an antenna
---

To build an antenna you need two electronic components. You also need to have looked at the example antenna [on top of the lighthouse](020-lighthouse.md).

# What components?
Like this:
![Antenna components](antenna_components.png)

# Where to find them?
 - One component is laying outside the hut
 - Other component you get after talking with the android in the hut and lifting it outside

Combine them in your inventory.

# I need another
 - One component is at the hardware graveyard. [It requires some work to get it.](080-molehole.md)
 - And the fourth component is at Nuwaka.

# Nuwaka?
[ Fix the boiler outside the hut to get it.](../040-nuwaka/140-boiler.md)
