At the lighthouse there is a cleaning bot working.

# How to catch it?
You would need a harpoon.

# Harpoon?
Yes, combine these two items:
 - [A harpoon](../040-nuwaka/065-harpoon.md)
 - A string or a wire ^[ Get the guitar wire from the Tour Bus. Next to the toilet. ]

# I have them
Combine them in the inventory to create a Bit-Harpoon.

# Neat!
Use the Bat-Harpoon on the cleaning bot while standing on the ground floor.

# I got up!
After [you get down](040-outof-lh.md) you can pick up the damaged robot.
