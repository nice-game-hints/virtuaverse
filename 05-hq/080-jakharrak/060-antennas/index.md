title: Setting up the antennas
---

First things first: [You have to listen the archeologist' plan to set the antennas correctly](../050-plan.md)

You have to set up [two antennas](../070-build-antenna.md) in correct positions. 

# What positions?
You have [the radar](../010-archeologist.md) with you?

# I have the radar
[And you enabled it?](../015-scanner.md)

# It is enabled
Use the radar at different places. The noise will tell you where to set up an antenna.

# What places?
 - [The crashed plane](010-first.md)
 - [The hardware graveyard](020-second.md)
