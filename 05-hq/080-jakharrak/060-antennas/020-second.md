Use [the radar](../015-scanner.md) at the Hardware Graveyard.

# The android!
Give it the antenna.

# It has no arms!
Get it an extra arm. You have to discuss with it about its missing arm.

# Where?
At the hut. There is an extra android on the ground.

# Okay?
Get it's arm. You have to discuss with the graveyard android about its missing arm _first_.

# How?
Use the scredriver kit on it. You get an extra android arm. Now, give the arm to the android at the graveyard. He can now hold the antenna. Check the hut monitor.

# Orange?
Orange means that the signal strength is not strong enough.

# That android!
Maybe you could lift the antenna a little bit.

# How?
Like, with a wooden pole ^[You find the pole from the lighthouse second floor.]? Attach the pole to the antenna. You can get the antenna back from the android.

# It will fall
Attach it properly. You could tape them together.

# Tape?
There is some ducttape at the Tour Bus. In the kitchen cupboard. Use the ducttape on the antenna-pole combination. Give it to the android for better reception.
