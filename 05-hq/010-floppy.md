title: Reading the floppy disk
---

You got the floppy disk from Ramirez.

# How to read it?
You need a computer, of course. There is the Lorraine 500 next to the close with a floppy disk drive. It is just missing [a monitor](020-monitor.md).

# I have the monitor
Great. Use it on Lorraine 500.

# Still not working
You need to attach the monitor to the computer.

# With what?
With a cable. Search the box.

# How?
Just click on the cables until they clear up a bit. Then click on the free cables until you find the right one. It might take couple of tries.

# Found it!
Now use the cable on Lorraine 500 and then use the floppy disk on the floppy drive.
