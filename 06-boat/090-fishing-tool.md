Fishing tool is a perfect idea at the sea. Make it big enough.

# Where to?
The fishing line can be found below the deck. From the shelf.

# I have it
Then the hook. Did you find [the whale carcass](020-whale.md) already?

# I have the hook, also
Great, just tie them together. You have to try it.

# I don't know how
Well, who would?

# Of course
Talk to Capt. Vildenburg about knots.

# Now I know
Great, now you can combine them in the inventory.

# What else?
A proper fishing tool requires the plumb, of course.

# A plumb?
So that the hook does not float. Okay, the key here is an empty shrimp can ^[ There are multiple laying around in the command center ] and the lead wire ^[ You find lead wire from the whale carcass ].

# I have those
Now just melt the lead inside the can.

# Melt?
Use the pot and the stove.

# Tell me how
Put the pot on the stove. Switch the stove on. Put the lead wire into the pot. Use the towel to pick up the pot. Use the pot with molten lead on the empty shrimp can. Voil√°, a plumb.

# Okay...
Attach the plumb to the hook with a cord.
