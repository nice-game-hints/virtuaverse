Fishing hook with a cord? Why not!

# Where to?
The fishing line can be found below the deck. From the shelf.

# I have it
Then the hook. Did you find [the whale carcass](020-whale.md) already?

# I have the hook, also
Great, just tie them together. You have to try it.

# I don't know how
Well, who would?

# Of course
Talk to Capt. Vildenburg about knots.

# Now I know
Great, now you can combine them in the inventory.
