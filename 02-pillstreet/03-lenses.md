You need a replacement lenses for your AVR glasses.

# Where to?
Did you visit the Back Alley already? Go to the Alley behind the drug store and keep going to right.

# The beggar!
Yeah, he threw his glasses into the dumbster. But he won't let you take them.

# What does he want?
He wants to take trips. He is addicted to cartridges.

# Let's give him a trip.
Yeah, let's do. The smuggler (next to the drug store) is selling illegal cartridges.

# He doesn't accept cash
Give him your boosters ^[They are at your home, on the table].

# Heavenly...
That should do it. Give the Heavenly Cartridge to the Beggar.
