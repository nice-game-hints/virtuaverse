You need a spare battery for your AVR headset.

# From where?
Have you looked at your hoverboard ^[You can find it from your bedroom]?

# It has a battery!
Of course. Your screwdriver won't work on it, though.

# How to open it?
Get into [the shop](/02-pillstreet/020-shop.md) and buy the Screwdriver Kit. Use it on the Hoverboard to get a battery.
