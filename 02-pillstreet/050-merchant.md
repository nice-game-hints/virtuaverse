title: Dealing with the merchant
---

The merchant is not selling you his illicit goods.

# What to do wih him?
What is he doing with that computer all day long?

# What?
I think he is online dating. Married man!

# Right!
Maybe you could blackmail him.

# How?
Did you check the terminal? There is an online dating app.

# Interesting...
Use the app. [You need an online access card for it.](/01-apartment/02-videoarcade.md)

# I have the PlaySafe card
Great. Now, just look for the merchant from the list.

# Who is he?
Sam, 36. Next page.

# Found him
Did you already [buy the Heavenly cartridge from the Smuggler](045-cartridge.md)?

Now, given that you have tried to buy the trace activators from him already ^[Talk to him about them], he will start chatting with you in the online dating app.

# Hot stuff!
Nice, now to just get some proof to show to him.

# How?
Print the screenshot from the "PRINT" button. Show the photo to the Merchant. You should NEVER trust anyone online nowadays.
