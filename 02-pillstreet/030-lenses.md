You need a replacement lenses for your AVR glasses.

# Where to?
Did you visit the Back Alley already? Go to the Alley behind the drug store and keep going to right.

# The beggar!
Yeah, he threw his glasses into the dumpster. But he won't let you take them.

# What does he want?
He wants to take trips. He is addicted to cartridges. Talk to him and go through all the converstations.

# Let's give him a trip.
[Go get a dream cartridge for him.](045-cartridge.md)

# The cartridge
That should do it. Give the Heavenly Cartridge to the Beggar.

# It's...
...crap. Hmm.. maybe 16kB is not enough. Go ask the Smuggler for some [more heavy stuff](047-dope-cartridge.md).

# I have the cartridge!
Go give it to the Beggar.

# He does not want anymore
Doesn't know what is best for him, eh? Could you distract him?

# How?
With the dumpster. [The same dumpster the restaurant uses.](040-restaurant.md)

# He is distracted
While he is going through the trash, put the cartridge on top of his pile of cartridges.

# Far out!
Now you can get the lenses from the dumpster.
