The bouncer is blocking your entry to the place that definitely was a spare parts shop.

# How to get in?
He doesn't want money?

# No?
Maybe he is hungry, though?

# Hungry?
Yeah. Pizza would make his day.

# Hmm.. pizza
There is a terminal in the Main Street. Order him a pizza.

# How?
First, you need [a credit card](/01-apartment/03-drawer.md).

# I have the credit card
Second, you need the shop's address ^[Look at the address sign at the Backstreet.].

# Oh, cunning!
The drone will deliver the pizza and you get into the shop.
