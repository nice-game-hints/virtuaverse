There is the nice sushi restaurant at the Alley.

# What there?
That Silent Chap. We should mess with him a little.

# Mess with him?
Yeah! Make him angry.

# How?
Did you talk to him?

# He doesn't like spicy food
Exactly. And you really have to talk to him, first. Did you notice he is only eating from blue plates?

# Indeed
Spice up his food and see what happens.

# With what?
There is the vending machine on the Main Street. [You need some coins.](/01-apartment/02-videoarcade.md)

# I have the coins. What product?
The Spicy Juice, of course.

# What next?
Sit on the stool and put some Spicy Juice on a food on a _blue_ plate. The Chef wil l throw the food into the dumbster for the Beggar to enjoy it.
