To get into the shop, you have to [get rid of the bounce first](010-bouncer.md).

# I'm in
But the owner is throwing you out as you are not a "real AVR engineer".

# I am!
Prove it to him.

# How?
Show him the Ultra Glove of Power you have hacked ^[You can find it from your apartment upstairs, on the workbench, next to the game arcades.].
