This is the gradual, spoiler-free, hint system for VirtuaVerse.
VirtuaVerse is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Theta Division Games and published by Blood Music.

The player takes control of Nathan and has to collect items, talk to NPCs, and solve riddles in order to advance in the story. Later in the game, the player can toggle the protagonist's AVR headset, which allows them to see the augmented virtual reality, revealing different hotspots in the game's world. The AVR headset is needed to solve certain kinds of riddles.
