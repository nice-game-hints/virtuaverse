Your AVR headset is broken. You need components to fix it.

# What components?
First, you need to get out of [your apartment](01-getout.md).

# I'm out
Did you talk to the fellow engineer in [the shop](/02-pillstreet/020-shop.md)?

# So..
You need:
 - [Spare lenses](/02-pillstreet/030-lenses.md)
 - [Replacement battery](/02-pillstreet/090-battery.md)

# I have those
Now, get back to your Apartment (with the bike) and there you can fix the headset using the workbench.

# How?
While at the 2nd floor, use the Screwdriver kit to the Disposable AVR goggles to get the lenses. Then use the battery on the AVR Headset.
