title: Blueprint idea
---

The Dark Room really needs more variety. Maybe someone would have an idea about a new model.

# Who?
[Have you got access into the Control Room?](020-control-room.md)

# Yes
Talk to the Nerd, he is controlling the show.

# I talked
Look at his 3d printed chair and talk to the Nerd about his chair. He reveals to be a huge scifi fan.

# Trivia questions!
Answer whatever to them. But he already gave you the idea. Call to [the blueprint number](070-darkroom.md).

# I have to be more specific
Look at the alien poster in the Toilet. Call the smuggler again. He sends you the blueprint for Vanya to your Old Mobile Phone.
