You need to end the concert, eh?

# Where?
Do you have access to [the Control Room](020-control-room.md)?

# Yes
And you have talked with the Nerd?

# Yes
He is controlling the show. You should mess with him.

# How?
He was quite interested in the Dark Room.

# Go on...
And he is a huge scifi fan.

# Okay...
Get him such a tempting dark room experience that he will leave the controls.

# How?
Have you [figured out the Dark Room](070-darkroom.md)?

# I have looked at the number, yes
And [you have the blueprint in your mobile](080-blueprint-idea.md)?

# Yes
Great, now upload the blueprint into the darkroom ^[Use your phone on the touchscreen after clicking "upload".].

# It is ready
Have fun with Vanya in DarkRoom III room. Go tell the Nerd that Vanya is waiting for him.

# He is out!
Use the Great Console to end the concert.
