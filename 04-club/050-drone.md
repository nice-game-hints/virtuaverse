Have you talked to the guy next to the bathroom in the bar?

# Yes
Talk him to again. He is actually a veteran drone racer.

# Oh, how nice
Maybe he would give you _his_ drone if you ask real nice.

# He won't
Bummer. Maybe there would be another way to persuade him.

# Like?
Like getting him drunk!

# Of course!
Buy two drinks from the Robot Bartender and give them to the drone racer. After two drinks talk to him and ask for the drone.
